    """Subscribe to PUB socket and wait for build completion message.

    ``timeout`` is how long the build daemon may stay silent. It is not a
    budget for the build. The daemon publishes a heartbeat every ten seconds
    while it works, and each heartbeat pushes the deadline out again. So a
    build takes as long as it takes, and only silence fails.

    There used to be a second deadline as well, an absolute one. It started
    at the same moment and ran for the same duration, and nothing reset it.
    That made the heartbeat decoration: no build could last longer than
    ``timeout``, however healthy it was. Measured on a one-CPU node with
    three containers starting at once -- the hook gave up at 30s, and the
    daemon reported the build a success 11s later, into a container runc had
    already destroyed.

    One gap stays, and it is worth naming. A pump that publishes while Nix
    hangs is a pump that lies. This detects a dead daemon, not a stuck build.

    Raises SystemExit(1) on timeout or error.
