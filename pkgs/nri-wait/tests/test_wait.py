"""What nri-wait does while it waits.

A build is slower than any timeout somebody picks, so the hook does not
time the build. It times the daemon's silence. These tests hold it to that,
because the bug they follow made the heartbeat decoration: a second,
absolute deadline of the same length ran beside the resettable one and
nothing reset it, so no build could last longer than NRI_TIMEOUT.

    A unix socket path cannot exceed 107 bytes, and pytest's `tmp_path` is
    nowhere near short enough on its own: it carries the test name and a
    session number under TMPDIR.

    That is how this suite hung CI for a day. Nix's daemon builds in `/build`,
    so the path came to 77 bytes and everything passed. The CI runner installs
    nix single-user with no daemon, so a build happens under

        /home/runner/work/_temp/nix-build-nri-wait-0.1.0.drv-0/

    and the same socket came to 125 bytes. bind() then raised, the fixture
    never reached its teardown, and the leaked context wedged the interpreter
    at exit -- after pytest had already reported. Both builders sat there until
    the job timeout killed them.

    So the socket goes in a directory of its own, named as briefly as
    tempfile will, and never under `tmp_path`. TMPDIR is tried first, because
    that is the one place a sandboxed build may write. `/tmp` is the fallback
    for a TMPDIR too long to hold a socket at all, which no sandbox has and a
    deep checkout can.
