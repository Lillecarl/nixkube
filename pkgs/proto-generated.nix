# Not a fragment to splice into a build: this produces the complete project --
# `pyproject.toml` and `README.md` beside the `src/<package>` that protoc
# writes -- so the Python builder takes it as a plain `src`. Nothing in the
# checkout is `src/`; every module comes out of a `.proto`.
#
# Generating here rather than in the package's own build is what lets
# pyproject.nix build these at all. protoc runs each plugin as a separate
# process that has to import its own closure, and pyproject.nix's builders
# deliberately propagate nothing, so a codegen step inside the package would
# have to hand-resolve three plugin closures. `python.withPackages` arranges
# exactly that, and it belongs out here.
