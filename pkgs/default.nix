  # Every CI runner then built Nix from source, on both architectures, and
  # `build-amd64` and `build-arm64` both hit GitHub's six-hour job limit. That
  # skipped `build-manifests`, which publishes the image manifest and pushes
  # to cachix, so nodes could not find `nodeEnv` to boot with. Issue #9, now
  # closed.

  # Read the paragraph above as the trap, not as the current state. It said
  # "nothing has published since", which stayed true for a later and
  # unrelated CI break and sent someone to a fixed issue. An outage of this
  # shape looks the same whatever stopped the publish, so diagnose it from
  # the run list rather than from here.
