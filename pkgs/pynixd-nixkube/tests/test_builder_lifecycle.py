"""`BuilderManager.running()`, which owns the five loops and the probes.

Two things this states that nothing else does. The block ends the loops -- the
old `stop()` cancelled one task and the five were inside it, so a loop that
outlived the block would have been invisible. And a probe that raises does not
take the manager down: probes are per-node work, and the cluster has many
nodes.

The API calls are patched out. This is about lifetime, not about Kubernetes.
