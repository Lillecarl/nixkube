"""Retire the separate store of a node that now shares its host's /nix.

Issue #25. A node that moves to the host-store DaemonSet leaves
`hostMountPath` behind on its disk: the store, every volume prepared in it,
and the empty directories kubelet creates for a pod that never started.

**Deleting it while something mounts from it breaks a pod.** A bind mount
shares the directory's inodes, so the files vanish from the pod as well. So
it goes only when no mount in any mount namespace on the host has its
source inside it. A mount of a parent directory -- `/host`, kubelet's
directory -- does not hold it, and is not counted.

The host's mountinfo names a mount's source by device and by the path inside
that filesystem, not by a host path. `locate` turns the host path into the
same terms first, from pid 1's mountinfo.
