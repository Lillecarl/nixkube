    """Which containers have a build writing into their volume, and how to stop one.

    Membership is the volume sweep's interlock (issue #64). A build walks its
    closure with a checkpoint every 256 entries, so on a large closure it runs
    for minutes and the sweep gets to run in the middle of it. Removing the
    directory then deletes the destination mid-link, and the `FileNotFoundError`
    that follows names the *source* store path, so it reads as a corrupt store.

    Stopping is the other half. A container's removal arrives while that
    container's own build is running, and a sweep told to skip the volume
    leaves it until some later removal triggers another sweep -- on an idle
    node, indefinitely. `stop` cancels the build and waits for it to unwind,
    so the directory goes now.

    It keeps the set API (`add`, `discard`, `in`) that the ZeroMQ status query
    and the sweep already use.
