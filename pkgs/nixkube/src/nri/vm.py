"""A container's /nix under a runtime that runs the pod in a VM, such as Kata.

The namespace mount in `mount.py` cannot reach a VM: the pid the hook reports
is the hypervisor's. So the container's tree goes in as an OCI bind mount at
/nix, which the runtime shares into the VM over virtio-fs, and the build
fills it from the node side while the container waits.

The wait is in the container and not in the hook. Kata runs the agent's
CreateContainer before any createRuntime hook (katautils/create.go, kata
3.32), and the agent refuses there a command it cannot find
(rustjail/container.rs). A command that lives in /nix is not there yet. So
the container's args become a static busybox from the tree, running `WAITER`,
which then execs the original args.

Measured under CRI-O and Kata 3.32: a file and a hardlink made on the node
after the pod started are visible in the VM at once.
