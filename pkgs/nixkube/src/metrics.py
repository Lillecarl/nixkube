"""Prometheus metrics for the nixkube daemon.

Served on `METRICS_ADDR:METRICS_PORT`, which `cli.py` starts once at the top
of `async_main`. A DaemonSet pod answers for its own node, so every series
here is about this node and not about the cluster.

The server is the threaded one that `prometheus_client` ships. The daemon is
async and a thread is off-pattern, but the alternative is an ASGI server and
a second HTTP stack in the image for one read-only route. The values that
thread reads are lock-protected by `prometheus_client`, so the loop writing
them while it serves is safe.

**Every label here is bounded.** A store path, a container id or a pod name
would give one series per value, and a node sees thousands of each. `result`,
`kind`, `service` and `event` are written out in this file, and `command`
comes from an allow-list.

`prometheus_client` registers `ProcessCollector`, `PlatformCollector` and
`GCCollector` on the default registry by itself, so `process_cpu_seconds_total`,
`process_resident_memory_bytes`, `process_open_fds` and `python_gc_*` are
already served. Do not add a gauge for any of them.

    does not start -- and it is invisible from outside: the pod is Running and
    every probe passes either way. The two store paths in `state.json` are the
