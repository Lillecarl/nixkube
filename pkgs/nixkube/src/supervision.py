"""Crash-loop supervision for long-running coroutines, and background work.

Wraps coroutine factories with restart logic and crash-loop detection.
A crash loop is defined as max_restarts failures within a sliding time window.
When detected, CrashLoopError is raised. It leaves the task group that holds
every service, which cancels the siblings and exits the process (Kubernetes
restarts the pod with backoff).
