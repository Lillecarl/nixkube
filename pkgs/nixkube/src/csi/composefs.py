"""A CSI volume as one composefs mount. Issues #68 and #25.

`src/composefs.py` says what the image holds; `nix/composefs.nix` is the
derivation that builds it. This is the node's side: write that derivation
from the tools on this node's PATH, build it -- which substitutes an image
pynixd or CI already built -- and mount it at the pod's target.

**Same tools, same derivation.** `expression` must give exactly the
derivation `nix/composefs.nix` gives for the same roots, or a node never
finds the image in the cache and builds its own. The nixkube wrapper names
the tools in its environment, the same packages `composefsImage` passes.

**nixkube mounts it, not mount.composefs.** On a kernel without overlayfs
data-only lower layers (before 6.5, and no backport), libcomposefs retries
with a plain lower directory, the mount succeeds, and the whole base
directory -- the node's whole store -- shows at the volume's root. And
measured on an image whose file sits on overlayfs, as the test guests'
store does: EROFS refuses the file, libcomposefs takes a loop device and
then fails with EBUSY, where the same three mounts by hand succeed. So
`compose` makes them itself, and the probe goes through it: an image of one
file over a base directory of one other file, accepted only when the root
holds exactly the one file.
