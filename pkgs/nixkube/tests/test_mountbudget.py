"""What a node says before its mount table fills up.

`fs.mount-max` counts per mount namespace and a bind farm spends one per
closure path. Past the limit, mount(2) answers ENOSPC and names no limit --
partway through a closure, leaving a store that is half there. Nothing
outside a node can see this coming, so the daemon has to say it.
