"""`CreateContainer` stands down for a container that asked to be left alone.

`parse_nix_exclude` is tested next door, and a correct parser wired in too
late is the failure this file exists for: the exclusion has to happen *before*
anything reads the container's environment, because reading it is what leads
to `fetch_packages` realising a closure into the node's store.

The case that forced it: `appstarter-init` mounts its store at `/nix-volume`,
so the `/nix` check above it never matches, and its `APPSTARTER_WANTED`
environment named the closure of the very pynixd that would have had to serve
it. nixkube#55, nixkube#27.
