"""What the volume sweep removes, and what it must leave alone.

Issue #64: a build task fills a volume for minutes, yielding to the loop
every 256 directory entries, so this sweep can run in the middle of one.
Removing the directory then deletes the destination mid-link, and the
`FileNotFoundError` that follows names the *source* store path -- so the
failure reads as a corrupt store rather than as a race.
