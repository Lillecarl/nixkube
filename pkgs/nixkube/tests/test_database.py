"""`nix-store --dump-db | nix-store --load-db`, without a shell to hold the pipe.

The failure this file exists for is silent and has no deadline around it: the
consumer reads until EOF, and EOF arrives only when every writing descriptor
is shut. The parent holds one of those. Keep it open and `init_database` never
returns, which stops the mount that called it.

Real processes and a real pipe. A fake reader answers EOF whenever it likes,
so it cannot fail the way the kernel does.
