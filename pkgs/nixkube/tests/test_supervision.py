"""`detach`, which is what stops one container's failure ending the node's.

A task group cancels every sibling when a child raises. The groups these
children run in hold the CSI and NRI servers, so a build that fails on its own
container would take the server down, `supervised` would count a restart, and
five of them inside the window is `CrashLoopError` on a node that is working.

Nothing else catches this: a failing build is not a failing node, and no
existing test starts one in a group.
