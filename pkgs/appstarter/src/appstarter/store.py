# **`nix build` does not fail fast when a substituter cannot be reached.** It
# sits on the connect and retries, and `subprocess.run` with no timeout waits
# for as long as that takes. Seen on nixlab2, which is IPv6-only: an init
# container logged `fetching <cacheEnv> (pynixd: disabled)` and printed
# nothing for the next thirteen minutes, so the Pod stayed in `Init:0/1` and
# the fallback that exists for exactly this case never ran. `seed.run`
# catches `StoreError` and seeds from the image; with no bound here there was
# no `StoreError` to catch.
#
# Ten minutes, because a real cold fetch of a cache environment over a slow
# link is minutes and seeding from the image instead is a downgrade -- that
# node then runs behind until the next start. Settable, because how long is
# too long is a property of the link and not of this code.
