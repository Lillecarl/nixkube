# appstarter

Puts a usable Nix store on a node, then starts the application in it.

Two modes, and they run in different containers.

`appstarter init` runs in the initContainer, out of the container image. There
`/nix` is the image's own store and the target store is mounted somewhere else:
the node's host store for `nixkube`, pynixd's PVC for `pynixd`. It tries to
fetch the version the deployment asks for. If that fails, it copies the version
inside the image instead, so the workload starts rather than not.

`appstarter run` runs in the main container, out of the store `init` just
filled. It says which version is running and which one was asked for, then
`exec`s the application.

Both modes take the prefix a `/nix/...` path resolves under, and the two
containers of a pod see the same store under different ones. `init` writes
through a chroot store, so `/nix/var/result` is really
`<prefix>/nix/var/result`. The main container mounts only the store, at `/nix`,
so the prefix there is `/`.

## Why the image carries a second copy

`ekn.cacheTo` is pynixd. A pynixd that cannot start cannot be given the store
paths that would let it start, and the node behind it waits for a substituter
that is waiting for the node. Issue #27 is that cycle seen from the node, and
#46 is an initContainer sitting in `Init:0/1` behind it.

An image that can always start *something* ends the cycle. Degraded and running
beats correct and absent, for infrastructure other things depend on -- as long
as the skew is reported, which is what `run` is for.

## Why it reports rather than restarts

A newer version arriving is not a reason for the process to exit. Restarts are
the kubelet's business: `CrashLoopBackOff` reads a healthy upgrade as a fault,
a restart of pynixd fails other nodes' in-flight fetches because pynixd *is*
the substituter, and nothing inside the process knows whether a build is
running. So `run` states the skew, and something outside decides when to take
the new version.

## The environment it reads

| variable | mode | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APPSTARTER_WANTED` | init | The store path the deployment asks for, or a JSON object keyed by system. |
| `APPSTARTER_ROLE` | init | Which of the image's fallbacks to take: `node` or `cache`. From the pod spec. |
| `APPSTARTER_FALLBACK_<ROLE>` | init | The store path inside the image, one per role. Set by the image -- see `config.fallback`. |
| `APPSTARTER_FALLBACK` | init | One fallback, overriding the role. For a test or a single-workload deployment. |
| `FAKE_NSS` | init | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` and `/etc/nsswitch.conf` to install before Nix runs. Set by the package. |
| `PYNIXD_ENABLED` | init | Whether to ask pynixd as well as the configured substituters. |
| `APPSTARTER_STORE` | both | The prefix the store paths resolve under. Default `/nix-volume` for `init`, `/` for `run`. |
| `APPSTARTER_WANTED_STORE_PATH` | run | Written by `run` for the application it starts. |
| `APPSTARTER_RUNNING_STORE_PATH` | run | Written by `run` for the application it starts. |
