        A `tcpSocket` probe calls `connect()`, and the kernel completes that
        from the listen backlog whether or not pynixd ever accepts. So it
        passes against a pynixd that has stopped serving entirely, and fails
        only when a stall outlasts `timeoutSeconds` -- which a pynixd that is
        merely busy also does. It carries no information in either direction.
        Issue #53, and #37 before it.

        `/healthz` has to be answered by the event loop, so it cannot pass
        while the loop is stalled, and pynixd checks its own interfaces and
        loop lag behind it. A failure names the check in the response body.

          A pynixd busy ingesting a multi-hundred-megabyte store transfer does
          not answer inside a second, so the liveness probe fails, the kubelet
          kills the container, and the push dies with it. Measured twice on one

          tcp ...: i/o timeout`, then `exitCode: 143`.

          The push does not report a probe failure. It reports `Nix daemon
          disconnected unexpectedly`, which sends the investigation towards
          the network instead. Issue #37.

          This bounds how long the kubelet waits. What counts as too long a
          stall is pynixd's own `health_loop_lag_max`, 5 seconds by default and
          settable through `nixkube.pynixd.settings`. Set it from

                The image's own `cacheEnv` breaks both. `appstarter init`
                takes it when nothing else can serve the path, so pynixd
