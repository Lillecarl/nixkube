  /*
    A hostPath volume mounted with subPath is a trap on any distribution that
    runs the kubelet in a container.

    The kubelet performs a subPath bind itself, in its own mount namespace. A
    plain mount is handed to the runtime as a path instead, and resolves
    against the host tree. So the kubelet must be able to see the source, and
    for a hostPath volume outside /var/lib/kubelet it often cannot. It then
    binds an empty directory, with no error anywhere.

    A CSI volume is a different case and is allowed. Its source lives under
    /var/lib/kubelet, which a containerised kubelet must have or it cannot
    work at all.

    Both sides are measured, on Talos v1.13.9. One pod, one volume, mounted
    twice -- once plainly and once with subPath -- for each kind of volume:

      hostPath + subPath   source 0:62    overlay, container rootfs, EMPTY
      CSI      + subPath   source 253:5   xfs /dev/vda5, populated

    That contrast is the whole reason this assertion refuses one and permits
    the other.

    This is issue #16. It cost days to find, because the symptom named $PATH
    and not the mount. No test with a kubeadm control plane can catch it --
    kubeadm runs its kubelet in the host mount namespace. See issue #18.

    An env var with an empty string value never survives a round trip.

    `EnvVar.Value` is `json:"value,omitempty"` in the Kubernetes Go types, so
    the apiserver drops it:

      rendered   {"name": "PYNIXD_SSH_HOST", "value": ""}
      live       {"name": "PYNIXD_SSH_HOST"}

    So the rendered object and the live one differ on a field nobody can make
    match. That much is measured, on nixlab2.

    What is *not* established is that this causes a GitOps tool to report
    drift. It was reported here as the cause of an ArgoCD Application staying
    OutOfSync, and then disproved on the same cluster: Rook's
    ceph-csi-controller-manager carries the same shape, on the same
    Application, and ArgoCD calls it Synced. A tool that normalises against the
    live object does not care.

    The reason to refuse it is simpler and does not need the drift claim.
    Writing a field that cannot survive is writing something untrue: the
    manifest says the variable is set to the empty string, and no object ever
    holds that. Anything that later diffs, audits or reasons about the
    rendered form starts from a value the cluster never had.

    The value belongs somewhere the apiserver does not rewrite. A string inside
    a ConfigMap is not an EnvVar and survives, which is where pynixd's
    `ssh_host` went.

    This is the same family as a rendered `kustomize = {}`: any field the
    apiserver drops must not be rendered.

    Whose object is this.

    `config.kubernetes.resources` is every object of the whole instance, not
    nixkube's. A consumer deploys nixkube beside its own charts, so an
    assertion that walks the lot lets a nixkube module veto a neighbour.

    That happened. The empty-string check refused to render a 448-object tree
    over two env vars in Rook's ceph-csi controller, where `WATCH_NAMESPACE:
    ""` is the ordinary idiom for "all namespaces". Nothing of nixkube's was
    wrong. The subPath check has the same reach and escaped notice only
    because pairing hostPath with subPath is rare.

    So the assertion covers our objects, and a neighbour's gets a warning. A
    finding in someone else's chart is worth saying and is not ours to refuse.

    Every nixkube object carries this label -- measured over kubenixApply, 21
    of 21 -- because nixkube.matchLabels sets it and every resource merges
    those labels.
