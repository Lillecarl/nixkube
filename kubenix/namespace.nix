      Half the prune scope for a nixkube deploy.

      `ekn.environment` has no default: an apply deletes objects carrying
      this label that the apply did not produce, so two projects sharing a
      value on one cluster delete each other's work. `mkDefault`, because a
      deployment that installs nixkube beside its own objects wants one
      scope for all of them and says so itself.

      The other half is `ekn.dev/deployment-unit`, which easykubenix renders
      onto every object in a deployment unit. nixkube declares no units, so
      its objects carry no unit label and a whole-instance prune owns them.
