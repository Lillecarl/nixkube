        Taints the node DaemonSet tolerates, as a Kubernetes `tolerations`
        list. Empty by default, so the DaemonSet lands only where an ordinary
        workload would.

        This used to be an unconditional toleration of
        `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule`, which is right on
        a cluster that runs workloads on its control plane -- where nixkube
        was developed -- and wrong as a default. Shipped that way it assumes
        every cluster does that, and on one that respects the taint it puts a
        nix-node pod where an ordinary workload would not go.

        Set it to restore the old behaviour where that is what you want:

                        answers, and restart this container when it does not.

                        The sidecar was already here, calling Probe over
                        /csi/nixkube/csi.sock and serving the answer on 9808.
                        Nothing read it. So a driver that had become
                        unreachable stayed that way, and the only symptom was
                        pods stuck in ContainerCreating with no event to say
                        why -- kubelet cannot report a driver it cannot talk
                        to.

                        Measured: deleting /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/nixkube/
                        csi.sock left the DaemonSet 5/5 Running with 0
                        restarts, and a pod that wanted a volume waited 298
                        seconds without one thing changing. Unlinking the
                        path does not close the listening socket the driver
                        holds, so nothing inside the driver notices either.

                        failureThreshold x periodSeconds is 50s of real
                        unreachability before a restart, and
                        initialDelaySeconds keeps a slow start from counting.

                        The livenessProbe above restarts the container, and it
                        works. It does not report anything. A container with no
                        readinessProbe is Ready as soon as it runs, so
                        `kubectl get pods` said 3/3 Running, ready=true, for
                        every one of the six minutes its driver was dead.

                        Measured on nixlab2: a directory left where
                        /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/nixkube/csi.sock belongs makes
                        the driver die at bind, every second. restartCount went
                        3 -> 6 over that break, and nothing else moved. The
                        node stayed Ready and kept attracting builders it could
                        not serve, and a builder Pod on it sat in Pending with
                        `connect: connection refused` on the socket.

                        Same target as the livenessProbe, faster to fire:
                        2 x 10s reports NotReady about 30 seconds before the
                        5 x 10s restart. So the restart, when it comes, has a
                        reason visible ahead of it.

                        No Service selects these pods -- both Services select
                        component=pynixd, and this is component=node -- so
                        NotReady removes nothing from any endpoint list. It
                        only makes the report true.

                          names $PATH rather than the store.

                          Measured on Talos v1.13.9, one pod, one hostPath volume,
                          mounted twice:

                            /vol  (plain)           dev 253:5 xfs   nix/store = 242 paths
                            /nix  (subPath: nix)    dev 0:62 overlay   empty

                          and directly, through /proc:

                            host pid 1  mnt:[4026531832]  .../nix/store -> 242 entries
                            kubelet     mnt:[4026532779]  .../nix/store ->   0 entries

                          A plain hostPath mount is handed to the runtime as a
                          path instead, and resolves against the host tree. That
                          is also why appstarter-init sees a populated store
                          while nix-node does not: appstarter-init writes
                          through the plain mount at /nix-volume.

                          kubeadm runs its kubelet in the host mount namespace, so
                          no test with a kubeadm control plane can see this.
