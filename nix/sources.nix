# Where every dependency of this repository lives.
#
# nixidae is the umbrella that holds it, and the umbrella owns every source.
# Inside the umbrella that is the checkout two directories up. Outside it,
# the umbrella is fetched, and this working copy is put in place of the copy
# that came down with it. Either way the answer is the same one, so a build
# here and a build from the umbrella agree.
#
# A plain tarball is enough. The umbrella records every revision in
# nix/sources.lock, a file in its own tree, and the working copies beside it
# are ignored rather than committed, so a fetch that brings down none of them
# still resolves all of them.
#
# `..` from a store path leaves the store root, and Nix refuses that rather
# than answering false: "'nix' is too short to be a valid store path". So ask
# only when this checkout is not itself in the store.
#
# This repository is not a flake. Every entry point here takes the set this
# file returns and imports what it wants.

  # Where this checkout sits. Inside the umbrella, whether that umbrella is a

  # `../..` from a bare store path leaves the store root, and Nix refuses to

  # `builtins.tryEval` does not catch it -- measured, not assumed -- so the
  # question has to be avoided rather than caught.
  #
  # A bare store path is exactly `/nix/store/` plus one component. Anything
  # deeper has a directory between this checkout and the store root, which is
  # precisely the case where the umbrella is the thing in the store and this
  # checkout is inside it.

  # took the fetch below instead of the umbrella it shipped inside.
