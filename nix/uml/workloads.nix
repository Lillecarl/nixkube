# What a workload asks nixkube for, and how the test knows it got it.
#
# kubenix/ci carries workloads already, and most of them cannot run here:
# `flake-hello` fetches from GitHub, `expr-hello` builds from nixpkgs, and a
# build sandbox has no network. These are the offline half, written out
# rather than filtered, so each one says what it proves.
#
# Every job here reaches its binary through the path the pod asked the driver
# for, and nowhere else. That is not decoration: the node hands out no /nix at
# all of its own accord -- kubeadm patches give the control plane its store
# and nothing else gets one -- so a container whose command is a store path
# cannot start unless nixkube put the store there.

      Every job above starts, prints and exits, so by the time anything
      breaks the driver there is nothing left running. This stays up,
      holding a CSI volume and an NRI mount, and the question after each
      scenario is whether it still has them -- a pod that loses its /nix
      while running is a different failure from one that cannot start.

      `sleep` is a store path, which is also what makes the NRI plugin act
      on this pod. So one pod covers both.
