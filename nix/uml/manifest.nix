# What has to be true of a nixkube deployment for it to come up inside a Nix
# build sandbox, on User-Mode Linux.
#
# An easykubenix module rather than a patch to `kubenix/`: none of this is how
# nixkube should behave on a real cluster, and a default that only suits a
# test is a default that misleads everybody else.
#
# Two things are different in a sandbox, and both come from the same fact --
# there is no network:
#
#   images   Nothing can be pulled. Every image is imported into containerd
#            before kubelet starts (see ./images.nix and
#            `services.uml-k8s.extraImages`), so every container has to say
#            `Never` -- `Always`, which two of them do say, fails on an image
#            that is already there.
#
#   store    The node's Nix store is a directory of its own that the init
#            container fills by *substituting* into it, and there is no
#            binary cache to substitute from. So the guest fills it first:
#            its own /nix/store is the sandbox's, over hostfs, and
#            `nixkube-seed-store` copies what nixkube needs one directory
#            across before kubelet starts. The init container then finds
#            the paths already valid and copies nothing.

      A directory of the node's own, on the node's own filesystem.

      `/` was tried first, and it is very nearly right: the guest's
      /nix/store is the build sandbox's over hostfs, so pointing the node
      at `/` gives it a store that already holds everything the manifest
      names, with nothing copied and nothing fetched. The whole DaemonSet
      came up in 34 seconds that way.

      It breaks one thing, and the thing it breaks is not small. The
      driver's own state lives at `/nix/var/nix-csi` *inside the node
      container*, which is this path plus `nix/var/nix-csi` on the node.
      With `/` that is the guest's /nix -- an overlay, because a guest's
      whole /nix is one overlay mount over hostfs. NRI's read-write mode
      then asks the kernel for an overlay whose upperdir is on that
      overlay, and the kernel refuses:

          fsconfig('upperdir'=.../containers/<id>/upper): Invalid argument

      overlayfs does not accept an overlayfs as an upper layer. A real node
      has an ordinary directory here and never meets this, so the test was
      the only thing that did -- and it was hiding half of NRI.

      The cost is a copy: this directory is not the guest's store, so
      something has to fill it. `nixkube-seed-store` in ./default.nix does,
      before kubelet starts, from the guest's own store on the same disk.
      Measured at about 40 seconds, against `kubeadm init` taking longer --
      so it costs nothing in wall clock, and nothing is fetched.

    /*
      No substituters at all.

      Nothing needs one: `nixkube-seed-store` in ./default.nix copies
      everything this node will be asked for into its store before kubelet
      starts, so the init container finds the paths already valid.

      An unreachable substituter is worse than none. kubenix/ci lists
      cachix and cache.nixos.org, and each miss against those costs four
      HTTP retries and a DNS timeout against a resolver a build sandbox
      cannot reach -- which reads as a hang. Empty means a genuine miss
      fails at once and says which path:

          error: path '...-nodeEnv' is required, but there is no
          substituter that can build it
