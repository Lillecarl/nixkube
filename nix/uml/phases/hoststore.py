"""The node runs from the guest's own /nix, as on a NixOS host. Issue #25.

The guest is NixOS, so `nixkube-host-check` labels it, the separate-store
pod steps aside, and `nix-node-host` serves it with the guest's store and
the guest's nix-daemon. This asks what that has to mean:

  - the node carries `nixkube/host=nixos`, and the separate DaemonSet
    schedules nothing on it
  - no nix-daemon of nixkube's own: the guest's serves the socket
  - what the node runs, and what a volume reads, are rooted for the host's
    GC: Nix refuses to delete them, and deletes an unrooted path at once
  - the separate store at `hostMountPath`, which the step-aside pod's
    hostPath volumes created, is retired once nothing mounts from it
