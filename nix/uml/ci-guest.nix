    `nix run --file . ciTestCache.run` is the only end-to-end test of the
    node boot path, and it deployed `imagePullPolicy = "Always"`. So kubelet
    went to ghcr.io however the guest was prepared, and the test ran an
    `appstarter` this repository did not build -- a change under `pkgs/`
    could not be tried here at all.

    That is not hypothetical. `store.copy`, the fallback for a `nodeEnv` the
    node cannot fetch, called `nix copy` with no `--from`, so it read the
    default store through a daemon socket no appstarter container has. It
    could never have worked, and no test here could see it: the uml test
    seeds the guest store first, so the fallback never runs, and this test
    ran somebody else's binary.

    `IfNotPresent` and not `Never`. The CSI sidecars come from
    registry.k8s.io and still have to be pulled; only nixkube's own
    containers take this option. ./ci.nix imports the tarball carrying the
    matching tag.

    A claim the guest's disk can honour.

    The guest offers one hostPath volume whose `capacity.storage` is
    `boot.uml.diskSize`, because the volume is a directory on that disk.
    That is 8192Mi, and the default claim is 10Gi, so nothing binds and
    `pynixd-0` never schedules: `0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't
    find available persistent volumes to bind`.

    1Gi, against the 8.3M that run measured pynixd's volume using. The
    figure is a claim and not a reservation -- nothing enforces a hostPath
    volume's size -- so it buys nothing to ask for more.
