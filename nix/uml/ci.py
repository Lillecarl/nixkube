"""The kind jobs, on a guest.

Deploy nixkube with the same `kubenixDeploy` CI runs, deploy the test
workloads with the same one, wait for the jobs, then delete them and check
the CSI cleanup -- the steps of `test-kind-cache` and `test-kind-nocache`,
in order.

kluctl runs here, on the host, against the guest's API server through a
passt forward. That is where kind runs it too: on the runner, not inside a
node. It also keeps `kubenixCI1`'s `cachix push` pre-deploy step working,
because the token is in the host's environment and not the guest's.

Outside the build sandbox only -- the node pulls from registry.k8s.io and
what it deploys comes from ghcr.io:
